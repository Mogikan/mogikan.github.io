It's hard to start, but it's not hard to actually do.
Jekyll is awesome, as well as [github pages](https://pages.github.com/).
Many thanks to the following [article](https://devblast.com/b/create-a-static-websiteblog-with-jekyll-and-github-pages) which guided me how to create first blog post.
Next time I will publish more interesting posts regarding subjects I love.
